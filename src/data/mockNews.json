    "content": "# States' AI-Related Legislation Aimed at Insurance Is 'Unfounded', Says NAMIC\n\n*By Chad Hemenway | March 25, 2025*\n\nPolicy discussions on the use of artificial intelligence in insurance are \"unfounded\" and \"detrimental to policyholders,\" according to an analysis from the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies.\n\nThe use of AI in insurance underwriting and rate making has led to concern from some regulators, advocates, and policymakers over whether AI would lead to proxy discrimination, an algorithmic bias and eventual changes to the affordability and availability of insurance products in certain areas or for certain classes.\n\nNAMIC said 18 states are currently debating \"flawed\" AI-related legislation. Guidance from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has added to the \"nebulous concept of algorithmic bias,\" NAMIC said.\n\n> \"Contrary to what may be perceived as well-intentioned social efforts by regulators, policyholders will be harmed by growing efforts to elevate concepts of 'fairness' divorced from actuarial science,\" wrote Lindsey Klarkowski, NAMIC's policy vice president in data science, AI/machine learning, and cybersecurity. This will result in \"an inevitable break of the insurance product at its core,\" she added.\n\nKlarkowski authored the report, meant to dispel five myths about the use of AI and Big Data in the insurance industry.\n\n> \"In setting rules of the road, policymakers must recognize that insurance is distinct in function and pricing from many other consumer products,\" Klarkowski added in a statement. \"Insurance classifies based on risk, and insurance law requires those risk classifications to be actuarially sound and not unfairly discriminatory.\"\n\nAny regulation aimed at the industry's use of AI in pricing has to be unique to the industry, and any restriction on an insurer's ability to price a policyholder's risk will lead to more availability and affordability issues, NAMIC concluded, adding that the notion AI will lead to bias or disparate impact is in conflict with the risk-based foundation of insurance.",
    "description": "NAMIC claims that ongoing state legislative efforts and policy discussions about regulating AI in insurance are 'unfounded' and harmful to policyholders. They argue that insurance pricing is based on actuarial data, not bias, and warn that restricting insurers' use of AI could reduce the affordability and availability of insurance products.",
